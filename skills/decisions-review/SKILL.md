name: decisions-review
description: Use when reviewing Go code against Google's Go Style Decisions (the normative-but-subordinate document of opinionated style choices — naming, commentary, imports, errors, language constructs, common libraries, and test failures). Activates only on explicit request ("review with Google Go Style Decisions", "/google-go-styleguide:decisions-review") — does NOT auto-trigger on `.go` files. Findings are grouped by section, each tied to a detailed file in `sections/`.

# Google Go Style Decisions — Review

Code review skill based on Google's [Go Style Decisions](https://google.github.io/styleguide/go/decisions) — the second of Google's three Go style documents. Decisions is **normative but not canonical**: it's where Google readability mentors apply most concrete feedback, and it's subordinate to the [Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/go/guide) when conflicts arise.

> [!NOTE]
> This skill covers the **Style Decisions** only. The companion skills `guide-review` (the canonical foundational document) and `best-practices-review` (advisory patterns) cover the other two Google Go Style documents.

## When to use

- User explicitly asks for a "Google Go Style Decisions review" or types `/google-go-styleguide:decisions-review`
- User asks about a specific decision section ("how should I name receivers?" / "review my error handling against Google's decisions")
- User asks about a specific rule by anchor (e.g., `#initialisms`, `#in-band-errors`) — load the matching section file and answer

This skill does **not** auto-activate on `.go` files. Decisions is opinionated, and the user should choose when to apply it.

## How to use

Reviews run as a **parallel fan-out of subagents**, one per *section* (not one per individual rule). Each section file groups all the related decisions for one topic — so each subagent reasons coherently about (e.g.) all naming decisions together, instead of fragmenting tightly coupled rules across separate dispatches.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Before any subagent fan-out**, ASK the user which model to use for the per-section subagents: `opus` (highest quality, slowest), `sonnet` (balanced), or `haiku` (cheapest, fastest). Wait for their answer — do not pick for them. Pass the chosen model name to every dispatched subagent via the Task tool's `model` parameter.
>
> Skip this step only for the *Single-rule question* flow below — it loads one section file directly in the main thread, no subagents.

### Full review

1. Identify the Go files in scope and hold only their paths in the main thread.
2. For each `actionable` section in the index, dispatch a subagent with:
   - The section number, name, and path to its `sections/NN-*.md` file
   - The list of `.go` file paths to review
   - Instruction: load only that one section file, read the code, return findings in the format `<file>:<line> — <rule-anchor> — <one-sentence observation>` or the literal string `no findings`
3. Dispatch all subagents **in parallel** (single message, multiple tool calls).
4. Aggregate all subagent results, group by section (and by rule-anchor within each section), and produce the final report (see *Output format*).

### Partial review

If the user asks to check against a specific section ("review for naming and errors only") or specific rules ("only check `#getters` and `#in-band-errors`"), dispatch only the relevant section subagents — and instruct each subagent to focus on the requested rules within its file.

### Single-rule question

If the user asks about one rule specifically ("explain `#receiver-names`" / "does this code violate `#dot-imports`?"), skip the subagent fan-out: load the single section file directly in the main thread and answer.

### Why this pattern (sections, not individual rules)

- Decisions has ~65 individual rules; one subagent per rule is too much fan-out.
- Rules within a section are tightly coupled (all naming rules feed each other; all error-handling decisions cohere). A section subagent reasons about the whole topic together — fewer false positives, better cross-rule findings.
- Each section file still indexes every individual rule with anchor links to the source doc, so partial / single-rule queries work.
- Main context never holds more than one or two section files at a time.
- Parallel execution keeps wall-clock time low.

## Categories

| Category | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `actionable` | Generates findings during review |
| `philosophical` | Informs judgment, no findings emitted |

(Decisions has no `tooling` rules — the only tooling rule in the Style Guide framework is `#06 Formatting / gofmt`, covered by sibling skill `guide-review`.)

## Section index
